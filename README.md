## Divergent elliptical biface morphology: Distinct local retouch practice or serpent dance proxy for Elapids and Vipers?

### Basis of inquiry 

#### Background

Elliptical bifaces are prevalent at Mississippian and Caddo sites throughout the American Southeast, and are depicted in motifs that adorn shell gorgets and bowls, representing two distinct dances. Morphological attributes of elliptical bifaces used in Mississippian and Caddo imagery differ in noteworthy ways that are manifest in the associated material culture assemblages. Those from Caddo sites more readily articulate with the serpent dance, where the decorative motif portrays the emergence of the Hero Twins from the Beneath World; each grasping an elliptical biface.

#### Hypotheses

The elliptical bifaces used in this study come from two of the largest caches found at Caddo sites, and each was manufactured with a distinct raw material, providing for an empirical test of morphological differences as a function of raw material. If the elliptical bifaces were intended to represent local elapid and viper populations in the serpent dance, then their morphology may differ due to regional differences in biogeography. The sample of elliptical bifaces was also divided into two size classes; one conceptually reflective of production (large) or adult elapids and vipers, and the other with local reduction practices (small) or juvenile elapids and vipers.

Size classes were used to assess whether modifications by Caddo knappers may have yielded similar---convergent---biface morphologies in the small size class suggestive of relative standardization due to resharpening and/or retouch in one instance, and morphological divergence associated with adult elapids and vipers in the other. Size classes were also used to test two hypotheses related to morphological diversity; one where greater morphological variation would be apparent in the small size class due to idiosyncratic responses related to local retouch practices, and a second where greater morphological variation would be apparent in the large size class due to differences in constituent elapid and viper communities depicted by the bifaces. 

#### Results

Results demonstrate that elliptical biface shape does not differ by raw material, but size does, suggesting that a shared---and morphologically-consistent---mental template was maintained independent of biface size and constituent community differences in elapids and vipers. The subsequent analysis of elliptical biface morphology by size class demonstrated that size does not differ by raw material in the large class, but in the small class, it does. These findings support the argument that elliptical biface morphology diverges through local reduction practices, while simultaneously nullifying the hypothesis that biface shape reflects the morphology of local elapid and viper communities. As expected, greater shape diversity occurs in the small size class, where the Jowell Farm bifaces were found to be more morphologically diverse than those from Millsap Cache. Thus, distinct local reduction practices are advanced as the driver of extant morphological differences expressed in elliptical bifaces.
