    <p>Elliptical bifaces are prevalent at Mississipian sites throughout the American Southeast. Those from Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm comprise two of the largest samples of this ill-understood stone tool from the ancestral Caddo area. Bifaces from Millsap Cache were reportedly produced using Kay County flint, while those from Jowell Farm were manufactured using Edwards chert, providing for an empirical test of morphological differences as a function of raw material. The sample of elliptical bifaces was divided into two size classes; one conceptually reflective of production (large), and the other with local reduction practices (small). Size classes were used to assess whether modifications by Caddo knappers may have yielded similar—convergent—biface shape in the small class. Size classes were also used to test the hypothesis that greater morphological variation would be apparent in the small class due to idiosyncratic responses related to local retouch practices. Results demonstrate that elliptical biface shape does not differ by raw material, but size does, suggesting that a shared and morphologically-consistent mental template was maintained independent of biface size. The subsequent analysis of elliptical biface morphology by size class demonstrated that size does not differ by raw material in the large class, but in the small class, it does. This finding supports the argument that elliptical biface morphology diverges through local reduction practices. As expected, greater shape diversity occurs in the small class, where Jowell Farm bifaces were found to be more morphologically diverse than those from Millsap Cache. Distinct local reduction practices are advanced as the driver of extant morphological differences found in elliptical bifaces.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Elliptical bifaces have a deep history in eastern North America extending from the Middle Archaic to well past European contact. In many instances they have been deposited in caches, which may represent large, corporate bundles decommissioned amid polity demise or radical transformations in social practice. Stylistic changes are evident in both length and width for these bifaces, and result in great variability in shape and size. While some undoubtedly were knapped for every-day, mundane uses, others were crafted from exotic cherts and reflect non-utilitarian uses. The <em>oversize</em> or <em>exaggerated</em> forms, mimicking combat weapons, are often referred to as symbolic weaponry. Such objects are typically those “whose size, delicacy, material of manufacture, and craftsmanship are outside the bounds of any weapon that might have been actually used” .</p>
<p>The earliest elliptical bifaces, associated with Middle Archaic period, recovered as Benton caches (4500—4000 BCE) in the Mid-South , are clearly non-utilitarian, as they “meet the expectations of sacred markers for secular exchange” . In the western Middle Tennessee Valley, the Pickwick Burial Complex , dating to the Late Archaic/Gulf Formational period (3000—300 BCE) exhibits a continuation of bipointed blades, some notched or truncated, found in ritual caches and ceremonially broken. Elliptical bifaces find their most dramatic expression as Caddoan and Mississippian exaggerated, symbolic weaponry. Mississippian Ramey knives, dating from c.&nbsp;CE 1000 to 1300 are found associated with Cahokia political dynamics. The slightly later Duck River sword-form bifaces (CE 1275-1400) continue the emphasis on high-quality knapping and long-distance circulation. Such lanceolate blades, although smaller, continue into the early seventeenth century when they serve as regalia among political and social elites in ritual performances.</p>

<section id="methods-and-results" class="level1">
<h1>Methods and results</h1>
<p>To assess the variable impacts that Caddo retouch practices may have had on general morphology, the sample of elliptical bifaces was binned into two size classes using centroid size (<a href="https://seldenlab.github.io/elliptical.bifaces/">Supplementary Materials</a>). Due to potential morphological differences associated with the use of two distinct raw materials (Kay County flint and Edwards chert), the sample was subset by site prior to calculating the mean centroid size for each. Raw material for bifaces from Millsap Cache were identified by as Kay County flint, and those from Jowell Farm were identified as Edwards Chert due to their size, the colours that they fluoresce beneath low and high frequency UV light, and the paucity of similarly large locally-available raw material sources. Bifaces larger than the mean were assigned to the large category, those smaller than the mean were assigned to the small category, and the two datasets were joined in advance of analysis (<a href="https://seldenlab.github.io/elliptical.bifaces/">Supplementary Materials</a>).</p>
<p>Elliptical bifaces from Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm were used to examine whether biface morphology remains stable or expresses morphological variability by site/raw material (<a href="https://seldenlab.github.io/elliptical.bifaces/gm---siteraw-material.html">Supplementary Materials</a>). Prior to landmarking, elliptical bifaces were oriented with the most heavily retouched edge at top right (Figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:elliptical}\)</span>). Some bifaces include multiple areas of heavy retouch at the top and bottom of the same lateral edge (Figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:elliptical}\)</span>:b, c, d, and e), while others (Figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:elliptical}\)</span>:f) include one retouched edge at top right and another at bottom left.</p>
<p>To identify which edge was most heavily retouched, we employed a modified approach to the flaking index developed by . The modified approach uses counts of flake scars from both sides of each edge in the two most heavily worked areas, paired with a measure of edge length inclusive of curvature, which was calculated using ImageJ . The number of flake scars was subsequently divided by the length of the worked edge, with the most heavily worked edge identified by the greater value.</p>
<section id="geometric-morphometrics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="geometric-morphometrics">Geometric morphometrics</h2>
<p>The same landmark/semilandmark configuration was used for both analyses, and the landmarking protocol employs three landmarks; two horizontal tangents (top/bottom), and the third placed at the furthest extent of the retouched edge bearing the heaviest amount of retouch (see Figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:elliptical}\)</span>). Equidistant semilandmarks were placed between each landmark, applied using R and the <code>StereoMorph</code> package .</p>
<section id="generalised-procrustes-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="generalised-procrustes-analysis">Generalised Procrustes Analysis</h3>
<p>Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system , achieved through generalised Procrustes superimposition in R using the <code>geomorph</code> and <code>RRPP</code> packages . Procrustes superimposition translates and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects, while also scaling each biface using unit-centroid size—the square root of the sum of squared distances from each landmark to the specimen’s centroid . The <code>geomorph</code> package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:gpa}\)</span>) .</p>
</section>
<section id="principal-components-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="principal-components-analysis">Principal Components Analysis</h3>
<p>Principal components analysis was used to visualise shape variation among the elliptical bifaces, and the scatterplot and convex hulls represent the dispersion of shapes in tangent space (Figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:pca}\)</span>) . Shape space described by each principal axis is commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference image or 3D mesh .</p>
</section>
<section id="procrustes-anova" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procrustes-anova">Procrustes ANOVA</h3>
<p>To assess whether shape changed with size (allometry), and whether shape and size differed by raw material and size class, Procrustes ANOVAs were run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions . A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs , which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present .</p>
<p>The test for allometry did not return a significant result, suggesting that elliptical biface shape and size may follow a pattern of isometry, where shape remains constant throughout the reduction/retouch process (<a href="https://seldenlab.github.io/elliptical.bifaces/">Supplementary Materials</a>). Elliptical bifaces were morphologically consistent in shape across all analyses (<a href="https://seldenlab.github.io/elliptical.bifaces/">Supplementary Materials</a>). Results demonstrated a significant difference in size by site/raw material (RRPP = 10,000, Pr(&gt;F) = 0.0007); however, the subsequent analysis by size class demonstrated that the pattern is more readily attributable to reduction practices/intensity rather than nodule and raw material size (<a href="https://seldenlab.github.io/elliptical.bifaces/">Supplementary Materials</a>).</p>
<p>The analysis of morphology by size class demonstrated a significant difference in size between size classes (expected); however, the pattern deviated from our expectations. Elliptical bifaces from Jowell Farm differ in neither shape nor size between size classes (<a href="https://seldenlab.github.io/elliptical.bifaces/">Supplementary Materials</a>). Elliptical bifaces in the large and small size classes from Millsap Cache differ significantly in size (RRPP = 10,000, Pr&gt;d = 0.0035), but not shape (<a href="https://seldenlab.github.io/elliptical.bifaces/">Supplementary Materials</a>). Pairwise comparisons demonstrate that elliptical bifaces from Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm in the large size class are morphologically consistent, but those in the small size class differ in size (RRPP = 10,000, Pr&gt;d = 0.0001) (<a href="https://seldenlab.github.io/elliptical.bifaces/">Supplementary Materials</a>).</p>
<p>Thus, the pattern that emerges is one of differential retouch <em>intensity</em>, where isometric retouch strategies of Caddo knappers at Millsap Cache articulate with a different reduction practice thought to be associated with locally abundant raw material (Kay County flint). This finding is contrasted with the comparatively minimal retouch intensity of another group (Jowell Farm) where local raw materials were of poor quality and insufficient size, yielding a situation where it was necessary to import raw material from an extralocal source (Edwards chert).</p>
</section>
<section id="morphological-disparity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="morphological-disparity">Morphological disparity</h3>
<p>An analysis of morphological disparity was used to identify potential differences in morphological diversity between size classes . No difference was found in elliptical biface shape or size by site/raw material, but the comparison of morphological diversity by size class demonstrated that biface shapes in the small size class from Jowell Farm occupy a significantly greater range of morphospace than those from Millsap Cache.</p>
<p>The comparison of morphological disparity by size class demonstrated that elliptical biface shapes in the small size class at Jowell Farm occupy a significantly greater range of morphospace than those from Millsap Cache. This pattern suggests that the comparatively minimal retouch intensity associated with Caddo knappers at Jowell Farm may have been more targeted—potentially due to a lack of abundant local raw material of sufficient quality and size—resulting in a broader range of biface shapes in the small size class. Conversely, results also suggest that Caddo knappers at Millsap Cache employed a more standardized (specialized?) approach to reduction.</p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<section id="parallel-oblique-flaking" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="parallel-oblique-flaking">Parallel-oblique flaking</h2>
<p>When compared with other large finished bifaces in the region, the distinctive parallel oblique flake scar patterns on both faces of the elliptical bifaces for all, or virtually all, of their length is unique (Figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:illustration}\)</span>). The absence of identified preforms for this artifact type makes technological and/or attribute-based discriminations related to manufacture a challenge; however, one potential preform was recovered from mortuary contexts at Belcher Mound (Figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:illustration}\)</span>c). The projection of ritual and/or symbolic interpretation/s that articulate with this flake scar pattern is not possible at this time. Parallel oblique flake scar patterns are known to be characteristic of several dart point types of the late Paleoindian period , and has even been inferred from ceramic motifs in Peru .</p>
<p>Parallel oblique flake scar patterns are not characteristic of larger bifaces and bifacial knives in the American Southeast; thus, technological, cultural, or symbolic relationships between the elliptical bifaces and Angostura/Paleoindian dart points are not suggested here. The technological choice to use parallel oblique flaking in finishing the elliptical bifaces most likely represents, at minimum, a stylistic choice by knappers limited to this specific implement; although, that may have been a functionally-relevant choice given their shape and size. In some respects, the decision to employ parallel oblique flaking is as distinctive as the presence—although not diagnostic —of the flat and expanding flake scar pattern observed on Gahagan and Copena bifaces.</p>

<section id="data-management" class="level1">
<h1>Data management</h1>
<p>Reproducibility—the ability to recompute results—and replicability—the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result—are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). The analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through the <a href="https://seldenlab.github.io/elliptical.bifaces/">Supplementary Materials</a>, is available through the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/seldenlab/elliptical.bifaces">https://github.com/seldenlab/elliptical.bifaces</a>, and digitally curated on the Open Science Framework <a href="https://osf.io/ph25w/">DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/PH25W</a>. The reproducible nature of this enterprise provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components , which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge.</p>
<p>Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology , and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results . Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have—explicitly or implicitly—a major impact on scientific progress .</p>
