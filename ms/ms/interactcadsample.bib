   abstract = {We are now in the midst of a revolution in morphometric methodology. The new approaches are more effective in capturing information about the shape of an organism and result in more powerful statistical procedures for testing for differences in s shape. They are also more effective in enabling a researcher to visualize differences in shape and in suggesting simple traditional measurements that could be used in future studies. In this review we emphasize applications to exploratory studies in taxonomy and evolution.},
