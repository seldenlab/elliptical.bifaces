Selden, Jr.1 2022-11-07 Preface This process of comparison, of recognising in one form a definite permutation or deformation of another, apart altogether from a precise and adequate understanding of the original “type” or standard of comparison, lies within the immediate province of mathematics, and finds its solution in the elementary use of a certain method of the mathematician (Thompson 1917). Elliptical bifaces are prevalent at Mississipian sites throughout the American Southeast. Those from Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm comprise two of the largest samples of this ill-understood stone tool from the ancestral Caddo area. Bifaces from Millsap Cache were reportedly produced using Kay County flint, while those from Jowell Farm were manufactured using Edwards chert, providing for an empirical test of morphological differences as a function of raw material. The sample of elliptical bifaces was divided into two size classes; one conceptually reflective of production (large), and the other with local reduction practices (small). Size classes were used to assess whether modifications by Caddo knappers may have yielded similar—convergent—biface shapes in the small class. Size classes were also used to test the hypothesis that greater morphological variation would be apparent in the small class due to idiosyncratic responses related to local retouch practices. Results demonstrate that elliptical biface shape does not differ by raw material, but size does, suggesting that a shared and morphologically-consistent mental template was maintained independent of biface size. The subsequent analysis of elliptical biface morphology by size class demonstrated that size does not differ by raw material in the large class, but in the small class, it does. This finding supports the argument that elliptical biface morphology diverges through local reduction practices. As expected, greater shape diversity occurs in the small class, where Jowell Farm bifaces were found to be more morphologically diverse than those from Millsap Cache. Distinct local reduction practices are advanced as the driver of extant morphological differences found in elliptical bifaces.

Elliptical bifaces have been found in all but one major drainage basin in the ancestral Caddo area (dashed/white). 0.1 Analysis overview Prior to landmarking, elliptical bifaces were oriented with the most heavily retouched edge at top right (Figure 0.2). The landmarking protocol uses three landmarks; two horizontal tangents (top/bottom), and the third placed at the furthest extent of the retouched edge bearing the heaviest amount of retouch. Landmarks and semilandmarks were applied in R 4.2.1 (R Core Development Team, 2022) using the StereoMorph library v. 1.6.7 (Olsen and Westneat 2015a). Some bifaces include multiple areas of heavy retouch at the top and bottom of the same lateral edge (Figure 0.2: b, c, d, and e), while others (Figure 0.2: f) include one retouched edge at top right and another at bottom left, similar to alternately beveled bifaces. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/ellipticalbifaces.png&#39;) Figure 0.2: Selected elliptical bifaces from the Jowell Farm site highlighting the most heavily retouched area identified using a modified version of the flaking index developed and advanced by Miller (2007), Smallwood (2010), and Miller and Smallwood (2012). To identify which edge was most heavily retouched, we employed a modified approach to the flaking index initially developed by Miller (2007), and later advanced and refined by Smallwood (2010), then Miller and Smallwood (2012). The modified approach uses counts of flake scars from each edge in the two most heavily worked areas, paired with a measure of edge length (inclusive of curvature - this is not a linear metric). The number of flake scars was then divided by the length of the worked edge, with the heaviest worked edge identified by the greater value. The same landmark/semilandmark configuration was used for both analyses, and the landmarking protocol employs three landmarks; two horizontal tangents (top/bottom), and the third placed at the furthest extent of the retouched edge bearing the heaviest amount of retouch (see Figure 0.2). Equidistant semilandmarks were placed between each landmark, and all landmarks and semilandmarks were applied using R (R Core Development Team, 2022) and the StereoMorph package (Olsen and Westneat 2015b). 0.1.1 Generalised Procrustes Analysis Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system (Bookstein et al. 1999; Gunz, Mitteroecker, and Bookstein 2005; Kendall 1981, 1984; Slice 2001), achieved through generalised Procrustes superimposition (Bookstein 1986; Rohlf and Slice 1990; Rohlf 1999) in R using the geomorph and RRPP packages (Adams and Collyer 2015; Collyer and Adams 2018; Adams et al. 2017; Adams and Otarola-Castillo 2013; Baken et al. 2021). Procrustes superimposition translates and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects, while also scaling each biface using unit-centroid size—the square root of the sum of squared distances from each landmark to the specimen’s centroid (Chapman 1990; Dryden and Mardia 1998; Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Dryden and Mardia 1993; Kent and Mardia 2001; Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/gpa.png&#39;) Figure 0.3: Results of generalised Procrustes analysis for elliptical bifaces from the Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm. Mean consensus configuration shown in black; individual bifaces in gray. 0.1.2 Principal Components Analysis Principal components analysis (Jolliffe 2002) was used to visualise shape variation among the elliptical bifaces, and the scatterplot represents the dispersion of shapes in tangent space (Adams, Rohlf, and Slice 2013; Bookstein 1991; O’Higgins and Jones 1998; Rohlf and Marcus 1993). Shape ranges described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference image (Klingenberg 2013; Sherratt et al. 2014). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/pca.png&#39;) Figure 0.4: PCA summarizing shape variation in elliptical bifaces. 0.1.3 Procrustes ANOVA To assess whether shape differs by size (allometry), and whether shape and size differed by raw material and size class, Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015). A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs (Adams and Collyer 2015; Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003). 0.1.4 Morphological disparity An analysis of morphological disparity was used to identify potential differences in morphological diversity between size classes (Collyer and Adams 2020; Foote 1993; Zelditch et al. 2004). 0.2 Primary findings Bifaces do not differ in shape, but differ significantly in size by raw material. Allometry (shape change with size) was not significant. Bifaces in the large class recovered from Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm do not differ in shape or size, suggesting consistent morphology in bifaces from the large class, supporting arguments for production-based standardization. Bifaces in the small class recovered from Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm differ significantly in size. Thus, while shape remains consistent, size differs, suggesting—at minimum—locally divergent approaches to retouch or retouch intensity. Morphological disparity in the shape of the small class is significantly greater at Jowell Farm, providing evidence for a more standardized approach to local retouch at Millsap Cache. This finding provides additional support for the hypothesis that greater shape diversity is associated with retouch efforts, rather than production. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/elliptical.illustration.png&#39;) Figure 0.5: Illustrated elliptical bifaces from a, an unknown location; b, Jowell Farm; and c, Belcher Mound highlighting oblique parallel flaking used in production. The specimen from Belcher Mound is a potential preform exhibiting oblique parallel removals consistent with elliptical bifaces from other sites in the region. 0.2.1 Summary The pattern that emerges is one of differential retouch intensity, where the isometric retouch strategies of Caddo knappers from Millsap Cache articulate with a different reduction practice thought to be associated with locally abundant raw material (Kay County flint). This stands in contrast to the comparatively minimal retouch intensity of another group (Jowell Farm) where local raw materials were of poor quality and insufficient size, yielding a situation where it was necessary to import raw material from an extralocal source (Edwards chert). Further, the comparison of morphological diversity by size class demonstrated that elliptical biface shapes in the small size class at Jowell Farm occupy a significantly greater range of morphospace than those from Millsap Cache. This pattern suggests that the comparatively minimal retouch intensity associated with Caddo knappers at Jowell Farm may have been more targeted—potentially due to a lack of abundant local raw material of sufficient quality and size—resulting in a broader range of biface shapes in the small size class. Conversely, these results also suggest that Caddo knappers at Millsap Cache employed a more standardized (specialized?) approach to reduction.

Funding Components of this analytical work flow were developed and funded by a Preservation Technology and Training grant (P14AP00138) to RZS from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT), and additional grants to RZS from the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033) and the United States Forest Service (20-PA-11081300-074). Funding to analyse the bifaces from Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm was made possible by support from the Heritage Research Center at Stephen F. Austin State University. Data management Reproducibility—the ability to recompute results—and replicability—the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result—are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). The analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through this document, is available in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/seldenlab/elliptical.bifaces), and digitally curated on the Open Science Framework (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/PH25W). The reproducible nature of this enterprise provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovaite et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020; Selden Jr et al. 2021a; Selden 2022), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have—explicitly or implicitly—a major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018).

This analysis follows recent analyses of Perdiz arrow points (Selden and Dockall, in review) and Gahagan biface morphology across the southern Caddo area and central Texas (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020; Selden 2022), where Perdiz arrow points and Gahagan bifaces have been found to differ in shape across the same geography as Caddo bottles (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2021). This analysis also follows another geometric morphometric analysis in which Perdiz arrow points from the ancestral Caddo area were found to differ as a function of time, raw material, and burial context (Selden Jr et al. 2021b). 3.1 Load packages + data # load required analysis packages library(here) library(StereoMorph) library(geomorph) library(tidyverse) library(wesanderson) library(ggplot2) # read qualitative data qdata &lt;- read.csv(&quot;qdata.merged.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, row.names = 1) 3.2 Generalised Procrustes Analysis Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system (Kendall 1981, 1984; Slice 2001), achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition (Rohlf and Slice 1990) performed in R 4.1.3 (R Core Development Team, 2022) using the geomorph library v. 4.0.4 (Adams et al. 2017; Adams and Otarola-Castillo 2013; Baken et al. 2021).
