Selden, Jr.1 and John E. Dockall2 2022-08-05 Preface Reproducibility—the ability to recompute results—and replicability—the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result—are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). Elliptical bifaces from the Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm (41AN13) sites comprise two of the largest samples of this ill-understood lithic tool from the ancestral Caddo area. Similar to Gahagan bifaces, those bifaces from Jowell Farm are assumed to have been manufactured using Edwards chert—due to their size, the colours that they fluoresce beneath low and high frequency UV light, and the paucity of similarly large locally-available raw material sources—and acquired by the Caddo through trade with central Texas groups. Bifaces from the Millsap Cache are thought to have been manufactured from Kay County flint, providing for an empirical assessment of whether elliptical biface morphology differs as a function of raw material. The sample from each site was subsequently divided into two size classes; one reflective of initial production/manufacture (larger), and the other associated with resharpening and/or retouch (smaller). Size classes were used to assess whether modifications by Caddo knappers may have yielded a similar—convergent—knife shape at the smaller size class, and to test the hypothesis that greater morphological variation would be apparent in the small size class due to the variable idiosyncracies related to resharpening and/or retouch. Results demonstrate that elliptical biface shape does not differ by raw material, but size does. This finding suggests both a shared mental template, and a size differential is potentially driven by raw material. Additionally, elliptical biface size in the large size class does not differ between raw materials; however, the small size class does. This finding aids in advancing the argument that elliptical biface morphology diverges through the resharpening trajectory, where bifaces from each site/raw material enter their uselife at a similar shape and size, diverging significantly in size—but not shape—throughout that uselife. In following with our expectations, greater shape diversity was found to occur in the small size class, where those bifaces from Jowell Farm were more diverse than those from the Millsap Cache. Discrete raw material differences are posited as the drivers of the extant morphological differences found in elliptical bifaces from the ancestral Caddo area. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/map.png&#39;) Figure 0.1: Geological map illustrating the location of the Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm, the level three ecoregions of the Arkansas Valley (blue), Ouachita Mountains (yellow), South Central Plains (orange), and ancestral Caddo area boundary (white) in the American Southeast. 0.1 Analysis overview Prior to landmarking, elliptical bifaces were oriented with the most heavily retouched edge at top right (Figure 0.2). The landmarking protocol uses three landmarks; two horizontal tangents (top/bottom), and one placed at the furthest extent of the area that includes the heaviest amount of retouch; all were applied using the StereoMorph package (Olsen and Westneat 2015). Some bifaces include multiple areas of heavy retouch at the top and bottom of the same lateral edge (Figure 0.2: b, c, d, and e), while others (Figure 0.2: f) include one retouched edge at top right and another at bottom left. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/ellipticalbifaces.jpg&#39;) Figure 0.2: Selected elliptical bifaces from the Jowell Farm site, highlighting the most heavily retouched area identified using a modified version of the approach developed and advanced by Miller (2007), Smallwood (2010), and Miller and Smallwood (2012). To identify which edge was most heavily retouched, we employed a modified approach to the flaking index initially developed by Miller (2007), and later advanced and refined by Smallwood (2010), then Miller and Smallwood (2012). The modified approach uses counts of flake scars from each edge in the two most heavily worked areas, paired with a measure of edge length (not linear/includes curvature). The number of flake scars was subsequently divided by the length of the worked edge, with the heaviest worked area identified by the greater value. The pattern that emerged suggested that the longest reworked edge on the elliptical bifaces was always more heavily retouched. This finding was used to incorporate the images of elliptical bifaces from the Millsap Cache (Millsap and Dickson 1968), where the longest reworked edges were oriented to the top right prior to landmarking. 0.1.1 Generalised Procrustes Analysis Landmark data were subsequently aligned to a global coordinate system (Kendall 1981, 1984; Slice 2001), achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition (Rohlf and Slice 1990) performed in R 4.2.1 (R Core Development Team, 2022) using the geomorph library v. 4.0.4 (Adams et al. 2017; Adams and Otarola-Castillo 2013; Baken et al. 2021). Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001). 0.1.2 Principal Components Analysis Principal components analysis (Jolliffe 2002) was used to visualise shape variation among the elliptical bifaces. The shape changes described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference image or 3D mesh (Klingenberg 2013; Sherratt et al. 2014). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;./images/pca.png&#39;) Figure 0.3: PCA of shape variables for elogated ovate bifaces. 0.1.3 Procrustes ANOVA To assess whether shape and size differed by raw material and size class, Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015). A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs (Adams and Collyer 2015; Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003). 0.1.4 Morphological disparity An analysis of morphological disparity was used (Collyer and Adams 2020; Foote 1993; Zelditch et al. 2004) to identify potential differences in morphological diversity between size classes. 0.2 Primary findings Bifaces do not differ in shape, but differ significantly in size by raw material/biogeography. Bifaces in the large size class recovered from the Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm do not differ in shape or size. This suggests consistent morphology in bifaces from the large size class, in support of production-based standardization. Bifaces in the small size class recovered from the Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm differ significantly in size. Thus, while shape remains consistent, size differs, suggesting—at minimum—locally divergent approaches to retouch and/or resharpening. Morphological disparity in the shape of the small size class is significantly greater at the Jowell Farm site, providing evidence for a more standardized approach to resharpening and/or retouch at the Millsap Cache site. That finding also supports the hypothesis that greater diversity in shape is associated with retouch and/or resharpening, rather than production/manufacture. 0.2.1 Summary The shape of elliptical bifaces does not differ significantly in either size class; however, size does. Results of the Procrustes ANOVA support the hypothesis for divergent morphology. The analysis of morphological disparity yielded support for the interpretation that greater morphological diversity is associated with resharpening and/or retouch, while providing additional support for morphological consistency in production/manufacture. 0.3 Acknowledgments Our thanks to the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, the Caddo Nation Tribal Council, Tribal Chairman, and Tribal Historic Preservation Office for permission and access to NAGPRA and previously repatriated collections.

Funding to analyse the bifaces from the Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm was provided by the Heritage Research Center at Stephen F. Austin State University. 0.5 Data management The analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through this document, is available in the GitHub repository, and digitally curated on the Open Science Framework. The reproducible nature of this enterprise provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovaite et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020; Selden Jr et al. 2021), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have—explicitly or implicitly—a major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018). 0.6 Colophon This version of the analysis was generated on 2022-08-05 11:04:04 using the following computational environment and dependencies: # what R packages and versions were used? if (&quot;devtools&quot; %in% installed.packages()) devtools::session_info() ## ─ Session info ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## setting value ## version R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23 ucrt) ## os Windows 10 x64 (build 19044) ## system x86_64, mingw32 ## ui RTerm ## language (EN) ## collate English_United States.utf8 ## ctype English_United States.utf8 ## tz America/Chicago ## date 2022-08-05 ## pandoc 2.18 @ C:/Program Files/RStudio/bin/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown) ## ## ─ Packages ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## package * version date (UTC) lib source ## bookdown 0.27 2022-06-14 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## bslib 0.4.0 2022-07-16 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## cachem 1.0.6 2021-08-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## callr 3.7.1 2022-07-13 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## cli 3.3.0 2022-04-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## crayon 1.5.1 2022-03-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## devtools 2.4.4 2022-07-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## digest 0.6.29 2021-12-01 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## ellipsis 0.3.2 2021-04-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## evaluate 0.15 2022-02-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## fastmap 1.1.0 2021-01-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## fs 1.5.2 2021-12-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## glue 1.6.2 2022-02-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## highr 0.9 2021-04-16 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## htmltools 0.5.3 2022-07-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## htmlwidgets 1.5.4 2021-09-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## httpuv 1.6.5 2022-01-05 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## jpeg 0.1-9 2021-07-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## jquerylib 0.1.4 2021-04-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## jsonlite 1.8.0 2022-02-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## knitr 1.39 2022-04-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## later 1.3.0 2021-08-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## lifecycle 1.0.1 2021-09-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## magrittr 2.0.3 2022-03-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## memoise 2.0.1 2021-11-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## mime 0.12 2021-09-28 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## miniUI 0.1.1.1 2018-05-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## pkgbuild 1.3.1 2021-12-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## pkgload 1.3.0 2022-06-27 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## png 0.1-7 2013-12-03 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## prettyunits 1.1.1 2020-01-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## processx 3.7.0 2022-07-07 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## profvis 0.3.7 2020-11-02 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## promises 1.2.0.1 2021-02-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## ps 1.7.1 2022-06-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## purrr 0.3.4 2020-04-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## R6 2.5.1 2021-08-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## Rcpp 1.0.9 2022-07-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## remotes 2.4.2 2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## rlang 1.0.4 2022-07-12 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## rmarkdown 2.14 2022-04-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## rstudioapi 0.13 2020-11-12 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## sass 0.4.2 2022-07-16 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## sessioninfo 1.2.2 2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## shiny 1.7.2 2022-07-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## stringi 1.7.8 2022-07-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## stringr 1.4.0 2019-02-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## urlchecker 1.0.1 2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1) ## usethis 2.1.6 2022-05-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## xfun 0.31 2022-05-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## xtable 1.8-4 2019-04-21 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## yaml 2.3.5 2022-02-21 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0) ## ## [1] C:/Users/seldenjrz/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.2 ## [2] C:/Program Files/R/R-4.2.1/library ## ## ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Current Git commit details are: # where can I find this commit? if (&quot;git2r&quot; %in% installed.packages() &amp; git2r::in_repository(path = &quot;.&quot;)) git2r::repository(here::here()) ## Local: main E:/github/elliptical.bifaces ## Remote: main @ origin (https://github.com/seldenlab/elliptical.bifaces) ## Head: [d10c909] 2022-08-05: &lt;init analysis&gt; References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
